    <h1>Zero Trust Cybersecurity</h1>
    <p>
        Zero Trust Cybersecurity is a modern security framework that operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify."
        Unlike traditional security models that assume everything inside the network is trustworthy, Zero Trust assumes that
        threats can come from both inside and outside the network. Therefore, no user, device, or application is automatically
        trusted. Every access request must be strictly authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated. This approach 
        helps prevent unauthorized access, limits the potential damage of breaches, and ensures that sensitive data remains
        protected. Zero Trust also emphasizes least-privilege access, micro-segmentation, and real-time monitoring to minimize
        the risk of lateral movement by attackers. As cyber threats become more sophisticated, Zero Trust provides a proactive 
        and resilient approach to securing digital environments.
